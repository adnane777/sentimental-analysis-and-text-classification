# Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to perform **sentiment analysis** on user reviews. The goal is to classify text data into **positive, neutral, or negative sentiments** based on word frequency and machine learning models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenisation, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatisation.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorisation and word embeddings.
- **Model Training**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
- **Data Visualisation**: Word clouds, bar plots, and sentiment distribution charts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Open `task3.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to **load data, preprocess, extract features, train models, and evaluate performance**.
3. Visualise sentiment distributions and top words using word clouds.

## Results

- Classified user reviews into **positive, neutral, and negative categories**.
- Identified the most influential words affecting sentiment classification.
